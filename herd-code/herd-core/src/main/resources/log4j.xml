   <!--
     This is a default Log4J configuration file that will automatically get read in and used by Log4J during application startup.
     It exists to ensure any logging performed before our real herd-log4j.xml initialization occurs isn't lost and will go to the console.
     In addition, it also prevents a Log4J warning to be displayed on the console that no loggers are configured.
     The herd-log4j.xml initialization occurs early in the Spring bootstrapping process, but still after other technologies (including Spring itself)
     already perform their own logging. Once the herd-log4j.xml logging initialization has occurred, the initialization that occurred based on this file
     is no longer relevant since it is no longer used.

        We are using "warn" as the default level which should prevent any logging from going to the console unless real warning or errors occur
        early during application startup (i.e. before the real herd-log4j.xml is initialized). If we want to get additional early logging such as
        Spring context initialization, etc., this can be temporarily configured to "info" or "debug" if needed.
